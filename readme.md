## 🧰 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint        | Description                            |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/`              | Returns a simple welcome message       |
| GET    | `/random`        | Returns one random quote from JSON     |

> Example response from `/random`:
```json
{
  "quote": "Stay hungry, stay foolish.",
  "author": "Steve Jobs"
}
```

---

## 🗃️ quotes.json

This API uses a local `quotes.json` file (no external quote APIs).

### Why?

- ✅ Full control over quote content  
- ➕ Easy to update or customize  
- 🛡️ No API limits or downtime  

> Example `quotes.json` structure:
```json
[
  {
    "quote": "Life is short, and it's up to you to make it sweet.",
    "author": "Sarah Louise Delany"
  },
  {
    "quote": "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.",
    "author": "Wayne Gretzky"
  }
]
```

## 🔨 Built For

Originally created as a utility backend service for:

👉 **NoteSphere** — a personal notes app designed to motivate, where each user session fetches a fresh inspirational quote.

---

## 📄 License

MIT — free to use, share, and modify.

---

## 💡 Why This Matters (Pitch)

I built **RandomQuoteAPI** as a demonstration of developer-first tools: a lightweight backend utility that delivers consistent, fast responses with zero dependencies. Whether you're bootstrapping a frontend app or prototyping a motivation tool like **NoteSphere**, this API serves as a flexible foundation. It showcases clean API design, simple data control, and real-world deployment — without relying on external services.
